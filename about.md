Hello! My name is Patrick Hammons! I like to drink coffee. When I do, it looks like this:

In 2015, I will be a Code for America fellow working with the City of Pittsburgh. I used to do GIS work for the City of Philadelphia. I **really** love Philadelphia. 

I also enjoy making maps, playing with data, learning code, and working on bicycles. When I'm doing these things, it's pretty common that I don't know how to do what I want to do. Sometimes it's hard to find answers to questions I have, so I have to piece them together from numerous sources and synthesize a solution myself. I find that I learn way more about the given technology I'm working with when I have to hack together answers myself, especially if I **write them down**.

So that's what this site is: a place to store the things I learn and how I learn them, ranging from in-the-weeds technical tutorials to larger scale thoughts about the things I'm into thinking about. If I should stop, feel free to tweet vaguely threatening things at me.
