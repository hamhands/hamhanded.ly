<h1 class="splash-header">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Patrick Hammons. I'm a civic-minded technologist and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/MaptimePHL/">Maptime</a> organizer.</h1>

<h2 class="splash-content">I like to build stuff and help others do the same. I make <a href="/maps">maps</a>, write some <a href="http://www.github.com/hamhands">code</a>, and occasionally produce <a href="/words">words</a>.</h2>

<h2 class="splash-content">Right now I work at <a href="http://www.esri.com">Esri</a>, building this thing called the Hub with these <a href="http://dc.esri.com">awesome folks</a>. Before that I worked with other great people at <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/pittsburgh/">Code for America</a>. Things are a little fuzzy prior to that, but luckily I <a href="../things/hamhandedly.pdf">made a list</a>. </h2>

<h2 class="splash-content">Thanks for hanging out!</h2>
